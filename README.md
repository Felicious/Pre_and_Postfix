# Pre_and_Postfix
CSCI 61 Data Structures Homework Assignment #2 : 
The objective of this assignment is to practice using the stack data structure by converting strings written in postfix (string of numbers and arithmetic operations, with the operators following the values it operates on) to prefix (operators precede the numbers). Originally written on April 20, 2017.

Program reads in a string already in postfix format and converts the objects into tokens, which are placed into the stack. 
Once an arithmetric operator is read, take the top two values on the stack and evaluates the temporary answer, and returns it onto the stack.
